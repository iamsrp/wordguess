# wordguess

## Overview

Yet another Wordle clone, since it's every programmer's duty to write one. This
one is a command-line Python script.

It does a reasonable job of being configurable, depending on the command line
options.

## Bugs

No known ones, but probably myriad unknown ones.

## TODO

Might be nice if it could:
  1. Keep track of your stats.
  1. Better handle non-English languages.
  1. Handle CTRL-L, for a redraw.
  1. Keep state, so that you can pick up where you left off.
  1. Use default preferences, from a `.wordguessrc` file.
